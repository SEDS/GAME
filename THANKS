GAME has been deeply influenced and improved by the following
graduate studets in my research group at Indiana University-
Purdue University Indianapolis in Indianapolis, IN. Our goal
is to see GAME continue to evolve and become a more comprehensive,
robust, and well-documented framework for
domain-specific modeling langugages design and implemented in
the Generic Modeling Environment (GME) that is freely available
to researchers and developers. If you have any improvements,
suggestions, and or comments, we'd like to hear about it.

Thanks,
